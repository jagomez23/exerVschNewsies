        <p>When you’re upset, though especially if you’re having a serious break down, like a panic attack – you’re not thinking clearly, and <b>everything seems much worse than it is</b>. If you’re anything like me, that means you’re going to start feeling guilty and angry with yourself for wasting time breaking down instead of doing something about the problem, and perhaps embarrassed that you, as a grad student, are breaking down at all. This, of course, only makes you feel worse, which perpetuates the panic, which makes you feel guiltier, and so on.
        So, this is me giving you permission to take a little time to be upset. You’re not wasting time. You’re not making things worse. Panicking can be valuable. 

        Reaching out for emotional support is important. If there’s a friend, a family member, or an RA you can reach out to, I highly recommend you do so. If there isn’t check out local  resources. A week after I found my grade, I immediately sought the help of a therapist. I will say It before and say it again: talking things out helps. She was the one that reminded me that I was still at a university, that I had a purpose here.
        <mark>Besides reaching out to talk about it, you should reach out to your department, your professors, your TA’s, and even just older members of your research group, if you’ve joined one. </mark></p>
